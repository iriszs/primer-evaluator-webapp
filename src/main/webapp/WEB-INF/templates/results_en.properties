GC.msg=GC percentage: 
homopolymer.msg=Homopolymer length: 
intermolecular.msg=Intermolecular length when both primers are used
interpertation.msg=A property that has passed will show 'true'. A property that has failed to meet the requirements will show 'false'   \
    The sequence content passes when it contains valid nucleotides (ACTG), the presence of 5'- and -3' (or 3'- and -5') and a\
    length of 18-22 nucleotides.\
    The GC percentage passes when the percentage is between 50 and 55%.\
    The melting temperature passes when it is between 50-60 degrees Celsius.\
    The maximum homopolymer length passes when it's below 4.\
    The intramolecular and intermolecular identity is to be validated by the user - it only returns the number of\
    nucleotides, since it is dependent on the situation.
